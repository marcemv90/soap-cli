`SoapCLI` is a small, dependency-light command line tool for sending SOAP requests over HTTP/HTTPS.

It is designed to be:

- **Simple** – single JAR, straightforward options.
- **Script-friendly** – works well in shell scripts and CI pipelines.
- **Flexible** – supports HTTPS with client certificates and configurable profiles.

If you find this tool useful and want to say thanks, you can buy me a coffee via PayPal:
